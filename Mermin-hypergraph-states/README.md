## Description

We study entanglement and non-locality of connected four-qubit hypergraph
states. One obtains the SLOCC classification from the known LU-orbits. We then
consider Mermin’s polynomials and show that all four-qubit hypergaph states
exhibit non-local behavior. "Finally, we implement some of the corresponding
inequalities on the IBM Quantum Experience. TODO: not accurate, implementation
is not done on the IBM Quantum Experience but runs on it, and you don't speak
about Maple in this paragraph, what is it's role ?"

Two softwares where used for this study: [Maple](https://www.maplesoft.com/) and 
the python library [Qiskit](https://www.qiskit.org/). The code used on those
softwares are distributed in their respective folders: in the 
[Maple folder](Maple) and in the [Qiskit folder](Qiskit).

A more literal description of the code can be found in the article 
[[BJH+666]](#ABJ20).
