## Description

We study entanglement and non-locality of connected four-qubit hypergraph
states. One obtains the SLOCC classification from the known LU-orbits. We then
consider Mermin’s polynomials and show that all four-qubit hypergaph states
exhibit non-local behavior. Finally, we implement some of the corresponding
inequalities on the IBM Quantum Experience. For a given hypergraph state, we
calculate its maximum violation of Mermin's inequalities by optimization
process.  We then construct the hypergraphstate on the IBM Quantum Experience
and make the measurements to verify the theoretical results. Maple was also used
to determine the orbit or SLOCC families of four-qubits hypergraph states. It is
based on the evaluation of invariant  and covariant polynomials. Two algorithms
were implemented : the first one determines the Verstraete family of a given
state, and the second one determines the corresponding strata of the nullcone
for nilpotent element. A third type of algorithms is proposed to determine the
singular type of a hyperplane section which is a SLOCC invariant of the
corresponding state.

Two softwares where used for this study: [Maple](https://www.maplesoft.com/) and 
the python library [Qiskit](https://www.qiskit.org/). The code used on those
softwares are distributed in their respective folders: in the 
[Maple folder](Maple) and in the [Qiskit folder](Qiskit).

A more literal description of the code can be found in the article 
[[ABJ+20]](#ABJ20).
