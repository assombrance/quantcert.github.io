\maketitle

This file is a demo that shows auto generated states and gates steps for
Deutsch's algorithm. They are generated using the file \verb@deutsch_trace.sage@
from the same folder.  Bellow are displayed the stated along Deutsch's
algorithm, with the matrix corresponding to each step, all automatically
generated as commands. Notice that some simple simplifications are not
performed, such as $1a \leadsto a$ or $\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2} \leadsto \frac{1}{
\sqrt{2}}$. This may be a task for a future version. Meanwhile, this is a simple
enough thing to do by hand if necessary.
