Execution instructions
======================

No specific installation is needed apart form python and/or an IDE like Pycharm
or Spyder. Start by starting the session of the chosen software.

Once in the session is started, you can simply run the calculations either
directly the file [run](/compile/run) in the IDE, or from python console as shown below.

The default calculation run corresponds to the quantum phase estimation
algorithm, the number of qubits is 3, and the second register is only one qubit.
For more general runs, just put the variable "test" in the [run](/compile/run)
file to False.

Example of usage:
The Python console simply launches with the command "python".
Run the program from a command prompt by going to the same working directory as
the file and typing :

```python
>>> python run.py
```
