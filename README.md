## Method of constructing a block design by Key and Moori

Key and Moori present a method of building a block designs completed with a part
on graphs that we are not interested in for our work. The linked source files
are present in the [Designs](Designs) part of this GitHub repository.

## Mermin Polynomials for Entanglement Evaluation in Grover’s algorithm and Quantum Fourier Transform

_Paper abstract:_<br/> 
The entanglement of a quantum system can be valuated
using Mermin polynomials. This gives us a means to study entanglement evolution
during the execution of quantum al- gorithms. We first consider Grover’s quantum
search algorithm, noticing that states during the algorithm are maximally
entangled in the direction of a single constant state, which allows us to search
for a single optimal Mermin operator and use it to evaluate entanglement through
the whole execution of Grover’s algorithm. Then the Quantum Fourier Transform is
also studied with Mermin polynomials. A different optimal Mermin operator is
searched at each execution step, since in this case there is no single direction
of evolution. The results for the Quantum Fourier Transform are compared to
results from a previous study of entanglement with Cayley hyperdeterminant. All
our computations can be replayed thanks to a structured and documented
open-source code that we provide.

## Entanglement and non-locality of four-qubits connected hypergraph states

_Paper abstract:_<br/> 
We study entanglement and non-locality of connected four-qubit hypergraph
states. One obtains the SLOCC classification from the known LU-orbits. We then
consider Mermin’s polynomials and show that all four-qubit hypergaph states
exhibit non-local behavior. "Finally, we implement some of the corresponding
inequalities on the IBM Quantum Experience.

## Automated detection of contextuality proofs with intermediate numbers of observables

_Paper abstract:_<br/> 
Quantum contextuality takes an important place amongst the concepts of quantum
computing that bring an advantage over its classical counterpart. For a large
class of contextuality proofs, aka. observable-based proofs of the
Kochen-Specker Theorem, we first formulate the contextuality property as the
absence of solutions to a linear system. Then we explain why subgeometries of
binary symplectic polar spaces are candidates for contextuality proofs. We
report first results of a software that generates these subgeometries and
decides their contextuality. The proofs we consider involve more contexts and
observables than the smallest known proofs. This intermediate size property of
those proofs is interesting for experimental tests, but could also be
interesting in quantum game theory.
