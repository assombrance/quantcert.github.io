### Mermin Polynomials for Entanglement Evaluation in Grover’s algorithm and Quantum Fourier Transform

_Paper abstract:_<br/>
The entanglement of a quantum system can be valuated using Mermin polynomials.
This gives us a means to study entanglement evolution during the execution of quantum al-
gorithms. We first consider Grover’s quantum search algorithm, noticing that states during the
algorithm are maximally entangled in the direction of a single constant state, which allows us
to search for a single optimal Mermin operator and use it to evaluate entanglement through the
whole execution of Grover’s algorithm. Then the Quantum Fourier Transform is also studied
with Mermin polynomials. A different optimal Mermin operator is searched at each execution
step, since in this case there is no single direction of evolution. The results for the Quantum
Fourier Transform are compared to results from a previous study of entanglement with Cayley
hyperdeterminant. All our computations can be replayed thanks to a structured and documented
open-source code that we provide.

### Phase sensitivity of entanglement in the Quantum Phase Estimation Algorithm

_Paper abstract:_<br/>
We study entanglement in the pre-QFT part of the Quantum Phase Estimation and the Quantum Counting algorithms. In particular we focus on the sensitivity of entanglement to the input value (the phase and the ratio of marked elements M/N) in some basic cases. One starts from numerical observations and deduce some general results in particular regarding the classes of entanglement.
