## Results provided by IBMQ Experience on January 4 2021 on the backend ibmq-casablanca (accessible via the research-q program)
## The first vector [(a,b,c),n] provides the line/context in decimal notation with its sign \pm 1
## The second vecteor [[p,q,r],[s,t,u],[v,w,x]] corresponds to the evaluated context in base 4 notation. The context is made of three measurements
## {'1':nbr1, '0':nbr0} corresponds to the results obtained by the IBM quantum machine for 8192 shots
## Then follows 2  figures: the sum of the expectation of the contexts, the global standard deviation
